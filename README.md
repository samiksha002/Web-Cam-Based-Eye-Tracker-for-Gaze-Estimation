This project is an advanced Eye Tracker System developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe,Machine Learning designed for real-time eye movement detection and tracking.

Features

High Accuracy: Achieved a 96% accuracy rate through precise calibration and machine learning integration.

Robust Performance: The system performs consistently in diverse environments, including different lighting conditions, by reducing sensitivity to positional changes.

Virtual Keyboard Application: Developed a virtual keyboard controlled by eye movements, offering hands-free typing functionality.

Technologies Used

Python: For building the core logic and machine learning integration.

OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.

MediaPipe: For real-time eye tracking and landmark detection.

Machine Learning: Model For Predicting the Gaze Point
