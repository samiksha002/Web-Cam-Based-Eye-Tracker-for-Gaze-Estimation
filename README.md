This project is an advanced Eye Tracker System developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe,Machine Learning designed for real-time eye movement detection and tracking.

This webcam-based eye-tracking system offers an affordable solution for tracking gaze direction, achieving 79% improved accuracy using a Multioutput Regressor with SVR, linear regression, and Kalman filtering for stability. Real-time pupil detection is facilitated by MediaPipe, with applications spanning healthcare (neurological disease detection), education (personalized learning), accessibility (device control via eye movements), and immersive gaming. Future work focuses on integrating AI and AR/VR while ensuring ethical use and data privacy.
